# GreenFin: Actuator

This repo serves as both a storage house for the climate that our system maintains,
as well as a library for providing our API with boundary conditions. The next
step will be integrating with microcontrollers to respond (or _actuate_)
according to the boundaries laid out by the client.

Or something.
